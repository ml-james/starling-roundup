###TODO:

* Fix broken DB writes and reads + write DAO tests to prove it...
* General refactor - can we simply the API, e.g. default category id required, round up goal name, photo...?
* Add more unit tests - are they necessary?
* Add ITs
* Documentation ... e.g. postman collections and setting up with Starling API ...
