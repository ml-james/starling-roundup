###TODO:

* Add IT for roundup action
* Add endpoint to retrieve roundup goal at any time + IT
* Add endpoint to edit roundup configuration, i.e. the maximum roundup and roundup multiplier
* Add some more unit tests (yawn)
* Documentation ... e.g. postman collections and setting up with Starling API ...
