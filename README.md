###Starling Roundup API

#### Instructions to set up a Starling developer account

* Please create a Starling developer account at https://developer.starlingbank.com/. For this you will need to use an Authenticator app to set up 2FA.
 * Register an application with Starling bank.
 * Now create a sandbox environment and link it with this application.
 * Create a customer or a set of customers.
 * For a customer you will have an Account Holder UID, Access Token and Refresh Token. You will need this Access Token to authenticate yourself from this API to Starling's.
 * You can simulate account activity, e.g transactions manually or by simulating a whole series of stuff with a click of the button.
 * Now you are set-up to run the StarlingRoundupApplication and start creating savings goals and rounding up those weekly transactions!
 
 Please find the Postman collection to guide you when testing both this API and Starling's API.
